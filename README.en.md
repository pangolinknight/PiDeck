**A desktop workbench for managing multiple [pi](https://pi.dev) coding-agent sessions across project folders.**

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.5.0-green)

`PiDeck` is **not** a fork of pi. It is a lightweight Electron shell that orchestrates multiple `pi --mode rpc` processes, providing a native desktop UI for projects, sessions, conversations, configuration, and tool orchestration — all powered by pi's native agent capabilities.

## 📋 Changelog

> **Latest: v0.5.0** (2026-06-14)

### v0.5.0 Updates
- 🎨 Major desktop refresh: the sidebar, header, composer, drawer, and Settings/Config/Feedback pages now share a stronger design-token system, with much broader dark-mode and localization coverage.
- 🧭 Workflow upgrades: project rows show recent sessions inline, left-click opens or reuses sessions, right-click is reserved for management, and Git branch creation, project reveal, and session deletion are now available.
- 🧩 Expanded capabilities: LAN web service, pi Extension management, PiDeck-styled custom selects, terminal dark-theme adaptation, and the full UI design audit documentation are now included.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-Project Workspace** | Add, search, drag-sort, and switch between local project folders. Run multiple pi agents simultaneously with per-project isolation. |
| **Built-in Chat Workspace** | A fixed Chat entry at the top of the project list writes to the app user-data directory for general conversations that do not need a code project. |
| **Configuration, Skill & Extension Management** | Visual editors for pi's `models.json`, `auth.json`, and `settings.json`, plus global Skill and Extension management. |
| **Proxy Settings** | Manage pi agent process proxy and desktop proxy separately; model discovery and connection tests can use the desktop proxy. |
| **Slash Commands & `!` Shell** | Built-in slash command suggestions (`/reload`, `/compact`, `/session`, …) and `!command` / `!!command` for inline shell execution directly in the chat composer. |
| **Embedded Terminal Dock** | Agent-scoped terminal tabs with PowerShell/cmd/sh fallback, multiple tabs, theme switching, height resizing, right-click selection copy, and close-all confirmation. |
| **Session Management** | Create sessions, browse inline project history, restore historical sessions, rename, copy, export HTML, delete history, and close agents from the sidebar or context menus. |
| **Git Integration** | Real-time branch display with local + remote branch selector, branch count badge, switching support, and branch creation. |
| **LAN Web Service** | Start a local web service from Settings so devices on the same network can open PiDeck through the host IP and port. |
| **Tool Call Visualization** | Grouped tool-call cards with summary and expandable details, clear status indicators for running/completed/failed calls. |
| **Session File Summary** | Completed agent runs show a compact list of modified file names and changed line counts; more than three files can be expanded. |
| **Context-Aware Input** | `@` file suggestions from project tree, `!` shell execution, `/` slash commands — all from a single composer. |
| **Update Prompt** | Periodically checks GitHub Releases and shows release notes plus recommended download links opened in the system browser. |
| **System Tray** | Close to tray by default, tray context menu, double-click to restore. |

## Screenshots

### Workspace & Conversation

![Workspace overview](docs/images/overview.png)

Markdown rendering with streaming text, tool-call details, session file-change summary, model/thinking/context/cache status bar, git branch selector, and action controls (New Session · Stop · Restart · Files · History · Terminal).

### Configuration Management

![Configuration management](docs/images/config.png)

Visual editors for Models (provider cards + model grid), Auth (API key management), Settings (type-aware key-value), and raw JSON source file editing — with save-and-reload to hot-apply changes to running agents.

### Slash Commands & Session History

![Slash commands and session history](docs/images/slash-commands.png)

Built-in slash command suggestions panel with descriptions, alongside the session history drawer for browsing and restoring past conversations.

### File Tree & Session Actions

![File tree and session actions](docs/images/files.png)

Project file tree with Git status indicators, `@` file reference suggestions in the composer, current-session modified file list in the Files panel, and session context menu actions (Rename · Copy · Export HTML · Delete · Close Agent).

## Architecture

```txt
PiDeck
├─ Electron Main Process
│  ├─ Project record management
│  ├─ Spawns pi --mode rpc processes
│  ├─ Manages agent-scoped local pty terminals
│  ├─ Bridges file / session / git operations
│  ├─ Checks GitHub Releases for updates
│  └─ Exposes safe IPC APIs
│
├─ Electron Preload
│  └─ Exposes window.piDesktop to renderer
│
├─ React Renderer
│  ├─ Project & agent list
│  ├─ Chat timeline with streaming
│  ├─ File / history drawers
│  ├─ Configuration and Skill modal (Configuration / Skills)
│  ├─ Agent-scoped Terminal Dock
│  ├─ Model & context status bar
│  ├─ Session file-change summary and update prompt modal
│  └─ Settings UI (Basic / Proxy / Developer tabs)
│
└─ Pi Runtime
   ├─ One pi RPC process per agent tab
   ├─ Per-project cwd isolation
   └─ Native pi sessions / tools / models / context
```

Core design principle: **one agent tab = one pi RPC process**, keeping sessions isolated and letting pi own its native behavior.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- `pi` command available in system `PATH`
- pi authentication configured (via `pi` / `/login` or API keys)

Verify pi is available:

```bash
pi --version
pi --mode rpc
```

---

## Download

Prebuilt packages for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** are published from tagged releases:

👉 **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ayuayue/pi-desktop/releases)**

> PiDeck requires the `pi` CLI to be installed separately and available in your system `PATH`.

---

## Quick Start (from Source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayuayue/pi-desktop.git
cd pi-desktop
npm install
npm run make-icon
npm run dev
```

---

## Development

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev mode |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run build` | Build renderer + main bundles |
| `npm run dist` | Package for current platform |
| `npm run dist:win` | Package for Windows (NSIS + portable + zip) |
| `npm run dist:mac` | Package for macOS (DMG + zip) |
| `npm run dist:linux` | Package for Linux (AppImage + deb + tar.gz) |
| `npm run make-icon` | Generate icon assets to `build/icon.svg` |

### Browser Preview Mode

Open `http://localhost:5173/` directly in a browser for layout and responsive checks. The renderer falls back to mock data when `window.piDesktop` is unavailable — useful for CSS/UI work without Electron. Real IPC features (agents, sessions, file ops) require the Electron app.

## Security

This app starts local `pi` processes and exposes limited file operations through Electron IPC. Only run from trusted source code. The app sends an anonymous, low-frequency `app_heartbeat` by default to understand version distribution, platform compatibility, and active installations; it can be disabled in Settings. It does not collect project paths, code, message content, session content, or file names, and it does not upload files. The third-party analytics service receives request metadata. pi agent process proxy and desktop model fetch/test proxy can be configured separately; external links opened in the system browser still follow the browser/system network settings.
